### TO IMPROVE
- add validation to ensure that each record contains 5 values in parse file (especially for data coming into the post request)
- upgrade the sorting function to take a direction as well
- add a query param for sort direction to the get requests
- add a get for the 'records' endpoint that takes a sort value as a query param
- error handling for when a record already exists
- decouple formatting code from sorting code

--- TODO 
- Add endpoint tests
- update readme
- postman collection of api-requests?
- help command on the cli for arguments?
